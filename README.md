# Volumetric

Concept: define a simple, dynamic, non-visual, spatial relationship between a human and a computer by taking a known one and shifting the terms by which it is dynamic

Methodology: allowing for the fine tuned control of an audio source's sound pressure level, what is perceived as 'loudness,' for a listener at a distance from that audio source.

These scripts to be paired with Ableton Live plugin correlating OSC messages (port 9000) to volume levels, uncurved.

Arduino and Processing code backing the theory and resulting implementation documented at http://www.iancallender.net/#projects-volumetric
